  <description>This planet is highly volcanically active and irradiated. It takes considerable effort to find a suitable spot to land, within the crater of what you hope is an extinct volcano. As your ship settles down, you see a thunderstorm off in the distance. It seems extremely unlikely that any life could exist on this hellish world.</description>
