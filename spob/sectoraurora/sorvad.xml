  <description>Sorvad is an agricultural paradise where all the food eaten by those who support and live under the central seat of the Empire is grown, and it is extremely well guarded. This planet is the life-line for the Aurora system itself, and without it, the central seat would starve. Sorvad is the least populated world in Auroran space with only eight hundred million inhabitants, which includes some twenty million warriors.</description>
  <bar>This bar is filled with many young warriors wearing the white and gold colors of the First Family. A few of the older ones are saluting their colleagues saying that they will probably meet each other next on differing sides of the disputes of their Houses.</bar>
