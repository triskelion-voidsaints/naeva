  <description>Ver'a He is the space-bound campus of the college of Ver'ash. This is where the young healer/engineering caste students come to be taught some of the different applications of their knowledge in a space-based environment. It is also the location of the advanced learning center for Ver'ash students who have passed the age of twelve. From here they journey throughout Polaris space under a tutor, learning the practical side of Ver'ash work, until the age of sixteen whereupon they become full members of the Ver'ash.</description>
  <bar>This small bar has a couple of older Ver'ash talking quietly one-on-one with young Ver'ash aspirants about some procedure you have no understanding of. Despite this you are made to feel welcome.</bar>
