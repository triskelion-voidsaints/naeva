  <description>Kel'ar Heper is the administrative headquarters for all the surrounding Polaris-controlled space. While the planet is under the sway of the Kel'ariy (as the leadership caste are known), the Tre'pira, the working caste, maintain a fairly large presence here to both support the Kel'ariy and to cultivate the extremely rich soil of this world. Kel'ar Heper is a mountainous, somewhat volcanic, yet still extremely beautiful world.</description>
  <bar>This bar has a large number of Tre'pira eating and drinking here as well as a few of the brown-cloaked Kel'ariy. You notice that the Tre'pira have an attitude of deference about them whenever dealing with them.</bar>
