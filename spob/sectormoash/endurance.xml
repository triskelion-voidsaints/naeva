  <description>This system is the second most likely route that invaders from the Heraan House might take. Ever since the Great Moash Invasion of their space some two centuries ago, the Heraan warriors have been more than willing to harass Moash space, so the warriors stationed here are almost constantly being raided. By the end of their stint here, if they survive, they are covered by the small green heron-shaped battle tattoos indicating successful engagements against the Heraan House.</description>
  <bar>The Moash House warriors drinking here have an air of arrogance about them as if they know they are members of the First Family and are somehow stronger because of it.</bar>
