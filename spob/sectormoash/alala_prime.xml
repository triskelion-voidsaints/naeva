  <description>The Moash House maintains their military headquarters here, and this is where their Mundokiir (as their general is titled) makes his home. There is also a sizeable garrison here, as Alala Prime is a mere one jump away from the system that is most at risk from an incursion from the Heraan House. Most young Moash warriors are posted here to learn their trade directly under the tutelage of their Mundokiir and his senior warriors before being sent out as veterans themselves.</description>
  <bar>This bar, called 'The General's Heart' is full of heavily tattooed warriors who are enjoying themselves without getting at all drunk. Obviously they are aware that they might be called out at any time, and so they are limiting themselves to only a few drinks each.</bar>
