  <description>This planet was the homeworld of the Atlanteans, or the 'Spark' as they are called by the Radiance. The planet is covered with millenia-old ruins, carefully maintained by the swarms of nanobots that cover the entire planet. More reverently, it is now the main home base of the Radiants, who now protect its secrets against the prying eyes and fingers of the 'unworthy'. You are the only human to have ever seen this planet, and you are likely the only one who ever will.</description>
