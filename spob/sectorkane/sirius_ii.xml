  <description>Sirius II came off second-best in the cosmic game of life, and never developed an atmosphere capable of stopping enough radiation to allow life to begin. It does, however, contain many lanthanides and actinides in its crust, and has been heavily strip-mined since its discovery. Life is harsh here, and the fatality rate for miners is very high. Death usually comes from radiation exposure, or exposure to the unstable heavy metals mined here. The Krim-Hwa maintain a monastery here on Sirius II, where they dare the elements in harsh self-imposed penance, or as a test of faith for initiates. Other than the monks, who are called here by faith, or the miners, who are called here by money, nobody comes here by choice. Sirius II also serves as a processing plant for the shells of the Monkdillo. The monks lovingly extract the shells from the Monkdillos after moulting season, similar to sheep shearing on old Earth.</description>
  <bar>You walk into the middle of a bar brawl. You duck a flying rock-drill, and attempt to order a beer, but you are blocked by the bodies of three young men as they hurtle across your field of vision. Needless to say, a rough place to drink.</bar>
