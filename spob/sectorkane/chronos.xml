  <description>From Chronos' watery surface you are afforded a fine view of the rising planet of Greenwich, and Chronos' sister moon Hourglass. Chronos is, as yet, uninhabited due to its thin atmosphere (which requires a breathmask for comfort). More than a few traders come here to refresh their tired spirits.</description>
