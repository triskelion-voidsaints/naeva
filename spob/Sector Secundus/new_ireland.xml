  <description>During the early years of colonization some of the troubled youth from a strife-torn province of Earth decided that they wished to leave. After many years of struggle, they made their home here. They decided that they wanted to leave behind everything they had grown up with, and slowly they, and their descendants, evolved a peaceful rural society. They have become an artistic, cultured, and hospitable people, but despite this remember that this world was colonized by people who had been forced to fight their entire lives to survive. Their skills have been passed down to the Wild Geese, perhaps the single toughest mercenary unit in known space, known for their fierce independence and near-suicidal bravery.</description>
  <bar>You walk into a dimly-lit, smoke-filled, wood-paneled room. You are immediately struck by its overcrowding, the huge volume of noise and by the small sign on the bar that says; "Roughnecks Need Not Apply."</bar>
