  <description>This planet is one of the most beautiful and temperate in the Empire. It is only lightly populated, and its main source of income is tourism. Water Moon is used by high ranking members from all the Five Families as a pleasure and relaxation retreat. A side effect of this is that a number of backroom deals between elders of all houses are thrashed out in the corridors of the hotels here.</description>
  <bar>When you walk into this room you notice five tables set apart at the rear of the bar. From what you can see through the smoke, it looks like representatives from each of the Five Houses are circulating between them.</bar>
