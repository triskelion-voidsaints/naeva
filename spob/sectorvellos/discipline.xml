  <description>This major military outpost is the furthest from the center of the Empire. It was built in this little dead-end system to surprise any invasion forces that the Federation might try to sneak around the normal frontlines. The warriors here spend most of their time training, so as not to lose their fighting edge during their mostly uneventful time here. This force has been steadily building up over the last decade, in preparation for a possible major push into Federation space in the next ten years or so.</description>
  <bar>This watering hole was built to allow the many warriors posted here to work off a little of the stress associated with living here. It is filled with warriors who are spending their off-duty hours trying single-mindedly to drink themselves legless.</bar>
