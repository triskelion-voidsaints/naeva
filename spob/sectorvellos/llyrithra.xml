  <description>This world, while technically part of the Auroran Empire, is left empty out of respect for the now long gone Vell-os. When the military leaders of the Vell-os destroyed the Overgate system nearly seven centuries ago, Manifest forces razed their worlds into lifelessness in retaliation and those Vell-os who did not flee were killed.</description>
