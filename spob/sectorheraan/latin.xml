  <description>Unlike the other four major houses, members of the Heraan Family do not hold scientists, merchants or any other members of their society in contempt, and so this place of learning is deeply respected by the warriors of the Heraan House. Also unlike the other houses, the Heraan Family try to get as many of their people to receive an education as possible. Given the enormous population within Heraan space, this means that the leaders of the Heraan House have a much larger talent and education pool to choose from than do the other houses. Perhaps this is why the Heraan Family, despite being relatively poor in terms of resources, is slowly becoming one of the most affluent.</description>
  <bar>Unlike similar establishments in other areas of Auroran space, here the students and teachers of the university are treated as respected equals by the warriors who come here. As you look around you can see members of the different faculties swapping jokes and stories with the many warriors who are drinking with them.</bar>
