  <description>Vulcan is the capital of the Federation and a hub of activity in the core worlds. 

This world was founded as the Manifestâ€™s nerve center for colonization.

Millions of colonists were processed here and sent to their final destination via the Kane Band, named for the messianic figure, Omata Kane. This massive ring laid the keels of thousands of colony ships and the ancestors of all Aurorans can be traced back to Vulcan. There are no greater shipyards anywhere in known space; in fact, Sigma Shipyards actually owns 62% of the band surface.

During the Second Dark Age, the remnants of the Manifest navy chose Vulcan as their final destination. It is perhaps no surprise that hundreds of years later, this planet would rise to protect the surrounding sectors, a duty that continues to this day.</description>
  <bar>A well-known haven to spacers, Kane's Lubritorium is known throughout the Federation for its warm flat beer from rusty taps. An acquired taste for sure.</bar>
