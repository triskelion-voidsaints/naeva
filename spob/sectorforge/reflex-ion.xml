  <description>Reflex-ion is a planetologist's dream, a world that looks destined to become an M-class planet which is in its early stages of formation. Of course this world is still uninhabitable, but the University of Misfire maintains a small research station here to study of the processes that go into the creation of an M-class planet.</description>
