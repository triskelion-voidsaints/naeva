  <description>Mining has never been a glamorous occupation, but it is one of the more essential activities that humans engage in. Herald has large stocks of many common minerals, and the metals and semi-metals common here are always in demand. Herald also has high concentrations of the material used to make duranium, which is much sought-after for use in space.</description>
