  <description>While the surface of the planet below is used to manufacture all necessary ship parts, these huge orbital shipyards are used to build and repair everything in the Tekel House fleets. This station is by far the busiest of all ports in Tekel space, as Auroran ships, due to the relatively low technology and the warlike nature of the Empire, are always coming in for repair. All Tekel warriors have a soft spot in their heart for this place, as without these facilities many of them would have died soon after battle, lost in the vast blackness of space.</description>
  <bar>This establishment is full of warriors drinking themselves into oblivion trying to forget just how close they came to dying. Many of the ships they arrived in were held together more by sheer willpower than by anything else.</bar>
