  <description>Nibos Prime is a mostly water-covered world. Its claim to fame is its beer. This is the birthplace of the extremely popular Nibos beer. While many other systems throughout the Empire have a Nibos brewery, many purists believe that the most flavorsome beer of the Nibos label still comes from here, where it is brewed in the Nibos main brewery.</description>
  <bar>This bar is filled with a few of regulars and a large number of Aurorans from all walks of life from throughout the Empire who have come to sample the beer from the original Nibos Brewery. Everyone agrees that there is no better beer served anywhere in the galaxy.</bar>
