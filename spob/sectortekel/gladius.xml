  <description>Due to the constant warring between the Empire and the Federation, the continuous sniping between the Five Families, and the constant striving of young warriors to achieve honor for both themselves and their house, Tekel warships are nearly always being damaged and destroyed. On Gladius, every part for every ship is manufactured and then shipped into orbit for assembly. Without these facilities, the high level of security maintained by the Tekel battle fleets would be impossible. Many seasoned warriors returning from battle have wept at the welcome sight of the Gladius Shipyards, as it was only then that they knew that they were going to survive and continue amongst the living warriors of Tekel House.</description>
  <bar>This bar is filled with tired grubby workers having a few drinks before heading home after work. Most seem almost too exhausted to talk, and the noise in the room, despite the hundreds of patrons, is uncomfortably low.</bar>
