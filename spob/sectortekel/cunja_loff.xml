  <description>This is the home world of the fearsome predator, the Cunjo. This deadly animal rivals the Vrenna Ice-Lizard in ferocity, speed, and strength, but unlike the Ice-Lizard, they have no valuable pelt, and there is no economic reason to hunt these huge, aggressive, and cunning creatures. Cunja Loff itself is an almost untouched paradise, with a wild, uncivilized feel to it. Many young nobles from Tekel house attempt to prove themselves as warriors by coming here to bag themselves the head of a Cunjo, even though many hunters have not returned. The hunting of a Cunjo, if done in groups of less than three, is worthy of a battle tattoo, and those who regularly come after the Cunjo find themselves covered with the brown tattoos that signify their prowess.</description>
