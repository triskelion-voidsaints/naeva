  <description>Tekel House warriors are brought to this barely habitable planet and abandoned for one week as a part of their initiation. Agrippa is scoured by occasional sandstorms of such incredible size and ferocity that few initiates might hope to survive one. Even if the wind remains low, the wide, expansive deserts bake all but the hardiest of initiates, and many still fall. That is why, when the young warriors of the Tekel House return from their initiation, many take as their death tattoo a symbol of the blazing sun. So many have done so that it has very nearly become the warrior symbol of the Tekel Family.</description>
