  <description>The Tekel House maintain their major supply depot on the surface of this world. Many of the arcologies that dot the surface of this once paradisiacal world are mostly filled with various military supplies and the emergency food stocks of the Tekel Family. Still, even though Nickas has a relatively low population, it is still extremely overpopulated. That, and the relatively low technology within the Empire, ensures huge pollution problems.</description>
  <bar>This room is filled with the administrators of this planet. They are all small quiet men with fastidious habits drinking weak alcoholic beverages in moderation.</bar>
