  <description>Fermia has never been colonized. Although its atmosphere is rich in argon and other noble gases, its turbulence means that harvesting requires a great deal of time and money. Only Boral, a relatively small independent mining company, operates here, and even then it only employs small-time prospectors who are foolish enough to brave Fermia's hostile atmosphere in order to make a few easy credits, 'no-questions-asked'.</description>
