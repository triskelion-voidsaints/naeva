  <description>Unlike its namesake, Las Vegas is one of the more prudish worlds in Federation space. Home to the Krim-Hwa religious organization, this cult is a fusion of many old Earth religions. This has created a culture of gentle, peace-loving people who spread their faith throughout the galaxy like the ivy winds its way through the hedgerow. Krim-Hwa monks are welcome anywhere in Federation space, where they minister to the sick and dying, and do charitable works. Led by His Eminence Cardinal Feroque deIgni, Krim-Hwa has maintained good relations with all other major powers in the galaxy even through some of the more turbulent times it has seen. Las Vegas is a farming colony, producing a significant fraction of the wheat crop of the Federation.</description>
  <bar>This is a quiet, well-run bar. After a few minutes you see a Krim-Hwa monk going around collecting money to support the many various charities they support. You end up giving more money to the Krim-Hwa than you spend on drinks.</bar>
