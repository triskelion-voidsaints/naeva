  <description>A paradise world, this is where all retirees from the Federation's military and intelligence communities reside. While New Babylon in the Nesre Primus system is the planet that every civilian aspires to live on, New England is where all those who strive to protect the Federation from all enemies, inside and out, hope to end their days. Its closeness to Sol enables these former service-men and women, who have made their home here, to keep up to date with all the news and events affecting the Federation they love and its surroundings. It also enables the Federation to call upon their many years of wisdom and experience in times of emergency.</description>
  <bar>As you walk into this bar, you are vaguely surprised to see that the average age of the patrons is around seventy. Despite this, they all seem to have retained their alertness and acuity because you notice that every single eye in the room gives you the once over as you sit down.</bar>
