  <description>Most of the wealth of the Fomalhaut system is generated by the mines of Gem. This planet has the richest veins of rare earths and minerals in known space. The workers are nearly all young men and women who feel trapped living on Snowmelt and are trying to make enough money so that they can leave the Fomalhaut system and travel to virtually anywhere else in the Federation; they don't really care. This trend has worried officials and bureaucrats on Snowmelt, who have instigated the 'Gem is truly outrageous' campaign in order to discourage youth from leaving, and robbing them of their workforce.)</description>
  <bar>This is something of a bar for yuppies. It has several televisions showing an archaic pre-hyperspace cartoon show about some singer and her band and their struggles with a rival group.</bar>
