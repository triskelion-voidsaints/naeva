  <description>Thriving on an illegal trade of many goods, Altia is a quick one-stop shop for the more shady side of Federation life. Most things can be bought (or stolen) here, and the populace is rarely constant. If a pirate has stolen a shipment of goods from you, then chances are it will end up here. A more insidious warren of backroom deals (or stabbings) cannot be found anywhere in Federation controlled space. The streets are inhabited with a curious mix of beggars, thieves, pirates, corrupt policemen and 'legitimate' businessmen, who for the most part survive with only the minimum of bloodshed required. Nobody wants a war.</description>
  <bar>This bar seems to be the place to go if you want to pick up goods of a somewhat shady origin. Drugs, illegal weapons contracts and similar types of deals are made all the time in this place.</bar>
