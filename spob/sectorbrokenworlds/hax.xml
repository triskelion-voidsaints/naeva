  <description>Hax, as it is called by the nav-buoys, is the sole survivor of the destruction of its solar system.  Wandering aimlessly throughout the cosmos, Hax is a broken heap of a world that outlasted its sun, a dyson sphere, and every other stellar body formerly present in this system.  Faint energy readings and a world-spanning metallic lattice suggest that this world was once a fortress against an unknown menace, and was heavily shielded in case of an attack. Evidently, it didn't help as much as they had hoped.</description>
