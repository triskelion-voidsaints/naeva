  <description>Though still marginally habitable, Seon is slowly but surely spiraling towards a fiery doom in the inferno of its red dwarf star.  Knocked out of orbit by an inconceivably powerful energy blast, Selon is mostly sterile desert, though a few oases and stalwart shrubs still dot the land.  This planet's unique atmosphere seems to cause a particle reaction in the air which absorbs heat and transforms it into a light metal mixture which constantly snows down onto the surface as sand.  Some kind of artificial mechanism must be responsible for this, for which you should be grateful: it is amazing that this planet can be comfortable when the sun fills almost a quarter of the sky.</description>
