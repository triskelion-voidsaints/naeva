  <description>This is a broken world that registers as Kyractus on your radar due to one of several ancient nav-buoys in this system still transmitting information.

Judging by the high levels of residual background radiation and the geological state of this world, this molten lump of sterile rock must have suffered a cataclysm of horrifying proportions, as the solid crust had reformed only several millions of years ago.

Wreckage of a titanic battle still lingers in this system, with several battered hulks of ancient worldships and the bare bones of an ancient dyson sphere. Whatever happened to these people happened on a scale and madness inconceivable to you. Any technology worth salvaging in this system is long dead or beyond repair.</description>
