  <description>During the Great Moash Invasion two centuries ago, warriors from the Moash House came to this system after clearing the rest of Heraan space. The warriors who were stationed here fought like demons and were able to hold off the battle-weary Moash fleets for many weeks. The leaders of the Moash Family then decided to surround the system and to starve those redoubtable warriors rather than face them in open battle. After the remnants of the Heraan House attacked Moash space, drawing their warriors home, they returned to find nothing but death. The only warrior to have remained at his post had scratched the word 'Mortosch' into his station before he died. 'Mortosch' means 'I have stood before death for too long'. This hulk is left completely empty in remembrance of those warriors who could not be defeated in battle, and as a reminder to young warriors of their mortality.</description>
