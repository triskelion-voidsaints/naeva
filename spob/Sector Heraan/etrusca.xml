  <description>This Auroran Triple Station is used to house an emergency hospital where critically injured warriors are taken if it is deemed that they cannot make the trip down to a planet. Otherwise, they would be taken to Tranquility in the Malo system; many of Etrusca's staff come from there, bringing their experience and knowledge with them. This station also serves as a training outpost for the medical students from the planet below, who come here to receive some 'on the job' training in real life conditions.</description>
  <bar>This tastefully furnished bar seems to be the drinking hole for the many members of the medical profession who live and work here. As you sit and listen you see a Heraan warrior walk in to quietly thank the staff for their efforts in ensuring his recovery from deaths door.</bar>
