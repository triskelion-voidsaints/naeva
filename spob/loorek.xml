  <description>This planet is almost entirely covered by water, with only a few isolated landing pads peeking above the surface. Below the water, the planet's seafloor is covered with the buildings of an apparently sunken mega-city, with a few tall spires sticking out of the water. What happened on this planet millenia ago is anyone's guess, but it seems unlikely to have been pleasant.</description>
