  <description>This planet is unlike anything humans have ever built, an artificial ring-world constructed around a dwarf star. The amount of resources and engineering skill required to create something like this must have been immense, and speaks to the power of the Atlantean civilization. According to the Radiance, another example survives in Polaris space, but surviving examples of these ancient marvels are quite rare.</description>
