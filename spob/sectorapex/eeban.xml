  <description>According to the story your Radiant guide has told you about it, this planet was once home to a bio-tech research facility operated by the Atlanteans. Looking around at this planet, you see the mounds of dead, toxic organic matter beneath the choking sky full of cyanotoxins. The Radiance assure you that the microbes are long dead, but it would be wise not to take that chance.</description>
