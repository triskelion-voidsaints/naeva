  <description>Thraine is named for a character from an old Earth book dating from before the collapse. Thraine got its name from its people, who tend to be short and stocky in build. The reason for this is that the first hypergates weren't tuned quite right for safe travel over long distances, and many mutations and deaths were common. The main feature of Thraine is the low dwellings of the inhabitants, who prefer depths to heights. Mind your head in the bar.</description>
  <bar>You have to bend as you walk into this bar. You find it in a state of joyous uproar as the diminutive inhabitants are getting drunk and jovially destroying this establishment. Even the bartender seems to be getting in on the act as he smashes the occasional bottle over the head of a patron that strays too close.</bar>
