  <description>This planet was apparently once home to a quarry where strange crystals were mined. It is not immediately clear what the purpose of the crystals was, but they appear to have a resonant frequency that is abnormally close to the very constant winds of the planet. The result is that the crystals 'sing,' lending an erie quality to this otherwise unremarkable planet.</description>
