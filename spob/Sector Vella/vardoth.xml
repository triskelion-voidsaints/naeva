  <description>This large battle-station stands ready to reinforce Vella space from Federation attacks from the east and north. The warriors here spend a fair amount of time defending against the small probing task-forces of the Wild Geese and Roughneck mercenary groups and returning the favor. The Vella warriors who live to see the end of their time here all carry a great number of the all-blue battle tattoos that are awarded after successful engagements against the Federation. It is named for the Vella engineer who first designed the current configurations of Deimos Hulk Stations that are now used throughout Auroran space.</description>
  <bar>All the warriors drinking here seem to have more blue battle tattoos than you are used to seeing in bars around Auroran space. Other than that, these warriors are like most of the others you have met. Well muscled, dangerous looking men and women who seem ever-ready to issue or accept virtually any challenge.</bar>
