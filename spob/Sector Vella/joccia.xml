  <description>This is a massive space hospital, and nearly all Vella warrior casualties are brought here. The nurses and physicians who live here all spend many hours a day attempting to save the many critically injured warriors brought to them, and although the conditions are still a little primitive, they do amazingly well. This station has only been in operation for less than a decade, but given the advanced nature of Vella medicine, it should soon be amongst the most advanced hospitals in the Empire.</description>
  <bar>A number of recovering, heavily tattooed warriors have come here and they seem to be spending their time toasting the efforts of every hospital staff-member they see.</bar>
