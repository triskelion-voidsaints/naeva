  <description>A small moon with no real resources or interesting features to speak of. A thin yet still breathable atmosphere surrounds Z'precti He. No life exists on this moon, as the last microbial life-forms became extinct approximately 3 billion years ago. Z'precti He has not been settled because the Polaris people do not yet require the space, and there is no other reason to settle here.</description>
