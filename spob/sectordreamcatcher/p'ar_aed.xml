  <description>The word P'aedt translates roughly as 'he who climbs the tree of knowledge, only occasionally falling', a surprisingly apt metaphor for scientific advancement in human history. Many notable scientific experiments have had horrifying effects on human civilization. The P'aedt have had only one fall from the tree of knowledge, and that is P'ar Aed. Some of the effects of their early experiments left this planet a polluted nightmare of a world. It is precisely for this reason that the P'aedt have claimed this world as their homeworld. They wish to remind themselves that they are no better than any other group of scientists from anywhere else in the galaxy, or from any other period of human history, for they too have a black mark. While a great deal of technological research goes on here, most research on this planet is directed to repairing the damage that they have done.</description>
  <bar>The many blue-coated scientists in this room all seem to be discussing differing ways of reducing pollution on a planetary level. The tired ring to many of these conversations suggests that a lot of what is being said has been said before.</bar>
