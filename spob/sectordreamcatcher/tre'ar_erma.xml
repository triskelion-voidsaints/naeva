  <description>Tre'ar Erma has only recently been colonized, and there is only one small Tre'pira methane-gathering operation present on the surface. The actual methane needs of the Polaris are only fairly small, but the Tre'pira recognize that they may need some more soon as the Polaris population increases. So, rather than reacting to a shortage, the worker caste started operations here.</description>
  <bar>This bar is a place for the small number of closely-knit Tre'pira who work here to unwind outside of their work environment where they are under constant pressure to perform.</bar>
