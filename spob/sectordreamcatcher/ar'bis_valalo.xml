  <description>This planet is named after Bis Valalo, the leader of the Polaris who decided to encourage the Polaris people to become members of castes, in order to pool their common knowledge and talents and advance knowledge more effectively. Oddly, the planet the Polaris have chosen as a memorial is dark and brooding, yet still beautiful in its own way.</description>
