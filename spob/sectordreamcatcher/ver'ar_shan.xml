  <description>The Ver'ash, as the healer and engineering caste are known, make their home here. As Polaris technology became increasingly biological, the professions of engineer and physician grew closer together, and as the caste system developed in Polaris society over the first century of its isolation, their work became so intertwined that they came together in the same caste. Ver'ar Shan is a highly technological world with buildings that are both hospitals and industrial workshops covering approximately a third of the surface of the planet. Nevertheless, a very beautiful world.</description>
  <bar>This bar is filled with jovial Ver'ash all having a few drinks on their way home from work. You soon become involved in several conversations around you, and you spend the rest of the night chatting with several of the inhabitants of the world.</bar>
