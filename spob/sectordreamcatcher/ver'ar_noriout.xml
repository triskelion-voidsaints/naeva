  <description>This is a highly technical world where nearly all of the useful biological agents cultivated on Ver'ar Pised in the Ver'avo system end up. They are used in the creation of medicines, and to help grow and repair the biological components of Polaris ships. Despite the numerous Ver'ash laboratories, Ver'ar Noriout remains an extremely beautiful planet.</description>
