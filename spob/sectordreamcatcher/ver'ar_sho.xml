  <description>Because the Nil'kemorya actually receive the most injuries (leading to the warrior caste having by far the lowest lifespan of all the castes, a mere 122.6 years), and their ships receive the most damage, they really require a separate facility to cope. The facilities on Ver'ar Sho, a small moon of Ver'ar Shan, are used as a military hospital and ship repair yard. Nearly all Nil'kemorya casualties, as well as a large number of damaged warrior caste ships, end up being treated here.</description>
