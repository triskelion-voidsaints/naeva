  <description>Schmoo is a beautiful world and is a favorite honeymoon destination for young couples from throughout the Empire. Many young honeymooners also buy a set of Lixos opals that are regularly supplied here, as they are seen as a good luck charm.
  This system is actually run by the Auroran central government, and is therefore policed by warriors from all houses. All young Auroran warriors must spend at least a year in service to the central Auroran seat in an attempt to reduce hostilities between the Five Families. Many of them end up here even though they are not really needed.</description>
  <bar>This cozy young bar is filled with small intimate alcoves filled with young couples enjoying each others company. The romantic atmosphere makes you feel uncomfortable and you resolve not to stay too long.</bar>
