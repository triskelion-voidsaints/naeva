  <description>This is where most critical patients and battle-injured warriors are bought. Many recovered warriors speak highly of the physicians and scientists in this place. Their existence has given at least a little credence, in the eyes of the warriors, for the necessity of the institution on Romule in the Rome system. The commanders of Kymonth Station ensure that only the hardest-working and most intelligent of the graduates are allowed to serve here.</description>
  <bar>This lounge is filled with tired doctors and nurses, most of which are trying to catch up on some sleep. As you talk to a few of them, you begin to realize how hard these people work. Most have not slept for days, some for weeks.</bar>
