  <description>This planet defies any conventional explanation. It is dotted with relatively human-like buildings, but they are just a little too small to have been designed by humans. The main landing site is a very clearly artificial landing pad with what appears to be a basic spaceport attatched to it.

As you wander around the deserted buildings, you cannot help but feel like something is watching you, something that doesn't want you here...</description>
