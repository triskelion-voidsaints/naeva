  <description>The Tre'pira built this station originally as a trade center for Tre'ar Pira but as Polaris society expanded, the worker caste expanded also. It has since been moved to a more central location. Now its primary function is to act as a logistical headquarters for the movement of the many thousands of Tre'pira shipments throughout Polaris space. The leaders of the Tre'pira all reside here.</description>
  <bar>This is perhaps the most luxuriously appointed bar you have seen anywhere in the galaxy. Only a few white-cloaked Tre'pira seem to drink here, but the drinks are the best you have had anywhere.</bar>
