  <description>Nil'ar Riai is the second in the series of three warrior caste training worlds. Young prospective members of the Nil'kemorya stay here from age twelve to sixteen. While they continue with their martial training, they also spend six months at a time with the other main castes. The reasoning behind this is that of all the castes, the warrior caste must be able to appreciate just how valuable the work of the other castes is, and just how difficult their jobs are. Many students leave the Nil'kemorya during this time.</description>
