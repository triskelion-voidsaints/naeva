  <description>This is a mountainous, pastoral world in the Tre'petaka system where members of Polaris society who have dishonored themselves, their caste, or nation in any way are sent as a disciplinary punishment. While they are here, these individuals are put to work performing menial duties as laborers in the mines or on the farms under the watchful eye of the Tre'pira.</description>
  <bar>The Tre'pira who live here all seem to be a little more serious than their colleagues elsewhere. Perhaps their duties as jailors weigh heavily on their minds. In here, most of them seem to be content to drink alone.</bar>
