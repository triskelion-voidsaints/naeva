  <description>Lupus is a formerly habitable world pocketed with uncountable craters from railgun slug impacts. The levels of cadmium and lead in the soil have reached industrial levels from the non-stop bombardment caused by the Federation navy using this world as cover and as a waypoint for their expeditions into the Aurora Empire.</description>
