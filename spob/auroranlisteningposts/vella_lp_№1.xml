  <description>This early warning post stands along one of the two main routes for interstellar traffic into Vella space from Moash space and the rest of the Empire. Given the constant internal wrangling between all of the Five Families, stations like this have proved to be a necessary part of the defense plans of all the houses. The use of these small listening posts has proven so successful that the Empire itself has also adopted their use as a part of its defenses.</description>
