  <description>The warriors at this early-warning station do not see a great deal of action, except for the occasional Moash patrol which tries to sneak around behind the major Vella defense points. This posting is usually given to warriors who have served the Vella House long and honorably, as a rest between being given more demanding positions. Those who serve here spend large portions of their lives training with and against each other, forever honing their fighting skills.</description>
