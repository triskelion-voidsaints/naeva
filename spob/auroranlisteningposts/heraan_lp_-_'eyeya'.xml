  <description>This small Heraan outpost is an early warning station manned by fewer than fifty warriors. It is named for the Thurokiir who came up with the original defense concept for Heraan space. The Mundokiir disagreed, and the Thurokiir came to this system to act as early warning to show that his plan was necessary. After two months of maintaining his impassivity at the mocking derision of his fellow warriors, he espied a large Dani battle-fleet hypering in. Not only did Eyeya warn the Mundokiir, he kept the Dani fleet busy for three hours by flying his personal fighter into the midst of the Dani formations and destroying a few key command ships. When they finally defeated him, the Dani fleet departed knowing that they could not defeat the Heraan fleets in their own space if they were pre-warned and prepared for their arrival. Nobody has since mocked Eyeya, his plan or his actions.</description>
