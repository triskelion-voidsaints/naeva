  <description>This is an old Manifest 'drifting space station', designed to provide a self-sustaining platform for deep-space exploration. The project was deprioritized by the council due to the outbreak of the Alien War, and was completely phased out shortly afterwards. Nevertheless, the self-sufficient stations continue to operate, occasionally coming close enough to a hyperspace path to cause explorers to stumble upon them.</description>
  <bar>There is a simple bar on this station, completely empty except for a few glasses left on tables, as if the crew of this station left in a hurry. A drinks-bot in the corner appears to still be functional, but the wisdom of ordering a beer that has sat on a space station for hundreds of years is questionable, to say the least.</bar>
