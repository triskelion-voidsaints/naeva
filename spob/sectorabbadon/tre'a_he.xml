  <description>More like a floating mountain than a sky-station, Tre'a He is maintained by the "Tre'pira", the name given to the worker caste, so that they can harvest the rare gases that are present in the ionosphere of Tre'ar Aeberl. These rare gases are later used as a catalyst in the process by which the Polaris 'grow' the biological portions of their ships.</description>
  <bar>This dark, cozy bar is said to be have been in operation ever since the Polaris built this sky-station some four centuries ago. It is obvious that in that time the barstaff have learned a thing or two about service, which is extremely good.</bar>
