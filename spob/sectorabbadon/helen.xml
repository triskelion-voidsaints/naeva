  <description>The inhabitants of Helen numbered many ecologists in the early days of settlement, and as such, much effort was made to hide evidence of human habitation. Most homes here are either underwater or underground, and many of the major cities straddle the line between coast and tidal breakers. Most power comes from thermal layer inversion pillars, which provide relatively low levels of power, but an inexhaustible supply of it. A green world with many different types of plant, Helen exports small amounts of plant material for use in expensive clothing. The line 'Made by Helen (tm)' is worn by the elite throughout the Federation.</description>
  <bar>Many of the patrons are wearing some of the latest 'Made by Helen(tm)' fashions that are only available on this planet. You shake your head, for you realize that these flimsy fashion garments will never last long, probably not even long enough for the next fad in the fashion industry.</bar>
