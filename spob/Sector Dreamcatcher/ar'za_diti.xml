  <description>Ar'za Diti is a moon named for Manifest Ambassador Arditi. He was the ambassador who decided to investigate Hexaporyen space, despite repeated warnings that any entry into their space would be viewed as an invasion. The resulting incident caused the Manifest to go to war against the Vell-os, and then the Polaris, and ultimately led to the disintegration of the Manifest and the centuries-long dark age that followed.</description>
