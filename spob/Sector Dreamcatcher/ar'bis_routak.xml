  <description>Ar'Bis Routak has a thin but quite breathable atmosphere. The Polaris named this planet after their first leader, Bis Routak, who led the Polaris expedition for their entire sixteen-year sojourn. He died four days after they landed on Kel'ar Iy, where they made their home. He held the Polaris together against all odds, and through often seemingly insurmountable difficulties, so in remembrance of his leadership, all Polaris leaders are given the prefix 'Bis' upon taking the mantle of command.</description>
