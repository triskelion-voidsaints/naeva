  <description>Though many virulent biological agents have been released into the biosphere of this planet, the surface of this world is devoted to the preservation of human life. The enormous hospitals dotting the surface of Joccika harvest these agents and turn them into useful medical substances. The physicians who work here are at the forefront of medical science in the Empire, and most new treatments for varying ailments come out of the research carried out by the many medical scientists who live here.</description>
