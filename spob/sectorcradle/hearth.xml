  <description>You'll often hear seasoned space pilots speak of "Hearth and Home" in spaceport bars across the galaxy. Far from being just a simple expression, it is, in fact, a reference to this unassuming planet in the Homeland system. Ex-spacers make a up a large percentage of the populace, and many houses follow the naming patterns of 'Dunroamin' and the like. Hearth is a mild M-class planet of rolling hills and gentle dales, which exports a moderate amount of agricultural produce to the outside universe.</description>
  <bar>This homey little bar has a large fireplace in which blazes a pleasantly warming fire. The bartender greets you with a casual familiarity and pours you the drink you want. He waves away your payment saying that the first drink is always on the house.</bar>
