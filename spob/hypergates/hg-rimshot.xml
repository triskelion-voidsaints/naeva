  <description>Rimshot's hypergate was a lucky survivor of the third dark age. However, it lay dormant for half a millennia due to the near-complete annihilation of the Overgate hubs. At the dawn of the 12th century, it was reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby Albion, Fyre, Manchester, Nesre Secundus and Vella systems. A fierce legal battle followed between Sigma and GLi-Tech, with Sigma winning ownership over the Gate on the basis of salvage rights. It is now their primary transit hub for the Forge sector, much to GLi-Tech's chagrin. Access is restricted to trusted Sigma employees, particularly those captaining bulk freighters to the distant Aurora Empire.</description>
