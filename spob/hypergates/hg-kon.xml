  <description>This hypergate was destroyed more than half a millennia ago at the conclusion of the Alien War. A shipment of hydrogen on a Pegasus-class freighter bound for Forge was the shipment on record passing through the ring when it was destroyed. This began a century and half period of isolation for the people of the Kon system, who found it difficult to expand on a cut-off water-world. Most new material was strenuously sourced from asteroid mining. When contact was re-established with the Overwatch, they joyously joined.</description>
