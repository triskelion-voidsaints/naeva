  <description>Tichel's hypergate was a survivor of the Alien War due to stubborn protection by Viking's defence forces. However, it lay dormant for half a millennia after the Polaris destroyed the Manifest's half of the Overgate hub. At the dawn of the 12th century, it was reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby Archenar, Codehaven, Kania and Nesre Primus systems. Access remains restricted to trusted Sigma employees.</description>
