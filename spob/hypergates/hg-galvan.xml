  <description>Galvan's hypergate was a lucky survivor of the Third Dark Age. However, it lay dormant for half a millennia due to the near-complete annihilation of the Overgate hubs. At the dawn of the 12th century, it was reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby  and  systems. Access is restricted to trusted Sigma employees, particularly those running important bulk deliveries to the Auroran Empire.</description>
