  <description>Archenar's hypergate was a lucky survivor of the third dark age. However, it lay dormant for half a millennia due to the near-complete annihilation of the Overgate hubs. At the dawn of the 12th century, it was reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby Fyre, Tuatha, Kania and Tichel systems. Access is restricted to trusted Sigma employees, particularly those captaining bulk freighters to the distant Aurora Empire.</description>
