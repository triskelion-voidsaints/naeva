  <description>You'd expect the BEC and palladium to be stripped to maintain the rest of the network of course. But the state this thing is in is astounding. Everything not bolted down is gone (right down to the traffic control computer!) and quite a bit that was bolted down seems to have been lasered out over the years. It's a wonder that the massive unfolding hinges haven't been scrapped too. Armetis couldn't have hoped to inflict this kind of damage.</description>
