  <description>While the Manifest built a gas mining outpost in this system, it was not Pyrogenesis One.
Nesre Secundus's hypergate was a lucky survivor of the Third Dark Age. However, it lay dormant for half a millennia due to the annihilation of the Secundus sector's hub. The local gas mining community did not survive isolation.
The gate was recently reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby Fyre and Rimshot systems. Access is restricted to trusted Sigma employees, particularly those piloting gas tankers.</description>
