  <description>Manchester's hypergate was a lucky survivor of the third dark age. The valor of fierce fighters and a heroic leader allowed the Manifest to maintain an outpost on the border of Vell-os space, but this hypergate nevertheless later lay dormant for half a millennia due to the near-complete annihilation of the Overgate hubs. At the dawn of the 12th century, it was reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby Enlightenment and Rimshot systems.</description>
