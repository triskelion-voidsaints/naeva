  <description>Enlightenment's hypergate was a lucky survivor of the third dark age. However, it lay dormant for half a millennia due to the annihilation of the Forge sector's hub. At the dawn of the 12th century, it was reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby Rimshot system. Access is restricted to trusted Sigma employees, particularly those captaining bulk freighters to the distant Aurora Empire.</description>
