  <description>Nesre Primus's hypergate survived the end of the Alien War due to the limited wartime exports from New Babylon. However, it still lay dormant for half a millennia due to the near-complete annihilation of the Overgate hubs. At the beginning of the 12th century, it was reactivated by the Sigma Shipyards corporation and jury-rigged to link to the nearby Athena, Gefjon and Tichel systems. Access is restricted to trusted Sigma employees, particularly those on important missions to the galactic north.</description>
