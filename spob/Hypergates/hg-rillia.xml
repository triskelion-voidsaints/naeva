  <description>This hypergate was destroyed more than half a millennia ago at the conclusion of the Alien War. A shipment of engineered wardogs on a Leviathan-class freighter bound for Allia was the shipment on record passing through the ring when it was destroyed. A lingering red mist coalesced among the debris for many years as the people of Porto Rillia languished alone. Thus the planetary governmentâ€™s reactionary obsession with spaceport development was to make up for the lost time.</description>
