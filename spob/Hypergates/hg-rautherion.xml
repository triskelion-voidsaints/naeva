  <description>This hypergate was destroyed more than half a millennia ago at the conclusion of the Alien War. A shipment of chrotite gas on a Kilmura-class freighter bound for Nesre Primus was the shipment on record passing through the ring when it was destroyed. Needless to say, the gas mining concern on Rauther did not survive the Third Dark Age cut off from broader civilization. This topic is evaded with nervous chuckles by the current Rauther Power Industries workforce on the moon.</description>
