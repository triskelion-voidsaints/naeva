  <description>This agricultural paradise was settled in the first expansion of the Manifest, and has had humans on it for over a thousand years now. It was also one of the earliest systems recontacted by Overwatch forces after the many hundreds of years without hyperspatial capabilities in the Third Dark Age. This planet deals in primary industries, and does not have the capability to process or highly refine the food and ores that are in abundance on this lush world, but that is exactly the way the largely conservative inhabitants like it.</description>
  <bar>Now this is what a pub should be like. It's small and dimly lit with a slightly overweight publican wearing a black apron. The beers are simple but pleasant and the atmosphere is friendly. Patrons exchange news and stories over a few drinks after working hard in the fields or the mines.</bar>
