  <description>One of the advantages of the Federation's policy of employing mercenaries for border guard duty is that forces are freed up for a floating reserve, which is a necessity to combat an enemy as dynamic and fractious as the Auroran Empire. Spacedock VI is the home of that reserve. The fleets here are constantly being dispatched to counter any breaches that may occur along the Auroran border and extinguish the enemy before they can cause too much havoc. This station acts as a centre of recruitment and rarely sees direct combat, though some fear that the day may come again when Auroran fleets threaten the Forge system. The commanders here guarantee that if that day comes, they will be ready.</description>
  <bar>This bar is filled with off-duty soldiers regaling each other about tales of the last Auroran warrior they hunted down. One involved a spirited chase through an asteroid field. It sounds like the Aurorans view trespassing into the Federation as a test of skill or courage, and thus the work of the Spacedock VI reserve will never truly be over even during apparent times of peace.</bar>
