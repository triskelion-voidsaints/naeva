  <description>Hypergate explorers stumbled across this rare jewel of a world during the late stages of Manifest expansion. They named it Xyon, after the Krim-Hwa god of peace and tranquillity. Xyon produces the lion's share of bioregenerative medicines for the Federation, which are refined via industrial catalyst from the plankton that live in Xyon's surface spanning ocean. There are some signs of prior habitation as well, and domes of plasticized water can be found dotted on the surface of Xyon near the poles. Old records reveal the minutes of a session of the Circle of Ministers where one of the Vell-os representatives described the travels of her ancestors across the disc of the galaxy to find a new home. She speculated that Xyon may have been a stepping stone on the long road to their homeworld, Vellos.</description>
  <bar>The bartender seems to be a little downcast as he serves you. When you ask he tells you that Xyon is not the best place for a pub, and that by his own reckoning he will be out of work in a few years when his creditors foreclose on his loan.</bar>
