  <description>Dunroamin was originally discovered and claimed by an itinerant prospector and space-tramp, but she lost it in a court case against the Colonial Scouting Corps (who claimed that it had been discovered months earlier by one of their long-range probes). The out-of-court settlement enabled that tramp, Felicia Kane (great grand-daughter of Omata Kane), to set up home here in the style to which she would become accustomed. Dunroamin is analogous to the legendary 'Beverly Hills,' with many holovid stars and sporting heroes making their homes here. The Federation Navy also has many bases on Dunroamin with large numbers of troops stationed here.</description>
  <bar>This very upper-class bar is for the very rich and the high-ranking officers of the Federation Navy. You quickly learn that while the service and drinks are of excellent quality, the prices here are heavily inflated.</bar>
