  <description>When the Heraan forces returned home after the Great Moash Invasion, many of the young warriors quite rightly accused the leaders of their house of bringing the invasion upon them through their incompetence. A group of thirty young warriors openly stated that if the leaders did not step down, they would be killed. The Thurokiir, as the arbiter of justice for the Heraan House is called, immediately challenged all of these warriors to a duel. They all immediately attacked, and the skill he showed whilst contending against them is still a legend amongst masters of the Heron unarmed fighting style. On that day, none of them could stand against him. He then stood before the ruling council and said with a quiet dignity, "A body cannot survive if its head is diseased." He then slit his own throat in shame. His name was Arik.</description>
