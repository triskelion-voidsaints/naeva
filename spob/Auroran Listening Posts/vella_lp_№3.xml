  <description>The warriors at this early-warning station face down the mercenary group known as the Wild Geese, whom the Aurorans call 'Archekro': 'they who dance with blood and war'. Evidently, the Vella give them a great deal of respect, and no warrior here doubts their ability to cause havoc in Vella space if given the chance. Consequently, those stationed at this listening post give a great deal of effort to deflecting any Wild Geese scouting party they encounter here.</description>
