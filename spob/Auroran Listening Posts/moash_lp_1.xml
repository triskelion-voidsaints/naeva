  <description>The Moash House maintains a small station manned by a small group of warriors here, in order to provide early warning to their battle fleets. The main threats that the warriors of this station are looking for are an invading Heraan task force, or a possible Federation incursion into the Empire. The warriors on this station all look a little bored, as they have seen no real action in or around this system for several years now.</description>
