  <description>Valoria is a desert world that is dotted with countless small oases. The Dani use this world as a hunting field and as an initiation planet. Potential Dani warriors are sent here for one month as an initiation. Surviving on this world for a month, due to the many oases, would not be an incredibly difficult task if it were not for the introduced Cunjo, the most vicious predator found naturally inside the borders of the Empire. The Cunjo hang around the oases in search of prey, which then makes the only habitable areas of this planet extremely dangerous. Many of the young Dani warriors have two rows of savage teeth laser-etched across their chest as their death tattoo.
  Due to the immense overpopulation of the Empire, Family Dani has been under pressure to sponsor arcology construction on this world as part of the End colony project. They have obliged financially, but the task of guarding the construction workers from the Cunjo has often fallen to apprentice warriors serving the Central Government.</description>
  <bar>This bar has a scene of Empire bureaucrats pleading with Dani elders to expand colonization on Valoria. Their pleas seem to be falling on deaf ears.</bar>
