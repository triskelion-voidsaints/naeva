  <description>The construction of the first Mickle arcology only began two decades ago, and is not yet finished. Though the only inhabitants at this stage are the construction workers, the construction of an arcology requires such an enormous amount of manpower that the number of inhabitants is already nearly a billion, all of them necessary to the work effort. The arcology should be finished in another decade or so, and then the First Family will organize to ship in billions of people to slightly relieve the population pressure on other worlds.</description>
  <bar>All the men drinking here seem to be overseers for the work going on around you. They are all complaining about the ridiculous demands being made of them by their boss in another system. They all end up leaving after grumbling that the only way to meet the demanded deadlines is to kill many of their workers.</bar>
