  <description>Named for the predators from Cunja Loff in the Tocc system, this station was built to keep an eye on the mysterious Polaris. Many young warriors set off from here to earn battle honors, and also to seek the coveted purple battle tattoo; it can only be earned in battle against the Polaris, as there is no more formidable opponent. Even surviving such an encounter shows skill, if not necessarily courage. This system falls under the control of the Auroran central government, as opposed to one of the Five Houses. Throughout all of 'Auroran Space', there are remarkably few systems that are governed by the central seat. The Five Houses do not allow it, for the seat is always held by one of them. They all know that if the First House became too strong, then they would be incapable of wresting power from it at some later stage.</description>
  <bar>Every warrior you see is covered in the purple battle tattoos given to survivors of engagements with the mysterious Polaris. Unlike warriors elsewhere, these men and women do not seem to be overly arrogant or confident. Perhaps it is because they have met and survived against an enemy far stronger than themselves.</bar>
