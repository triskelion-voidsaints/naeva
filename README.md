# Design
## Trade loops
Naeva's map has been reworked to focus on trade loops to encourage more varied travel and profit opportunities resulting from exploration. This trading system follows a few simple rules to reduce non-engaging behaviour:
1) Worlds will have a good they produce and a good they demand, this will be obvious
1) There will be no in-system trades
1) A profitable trade will be at least two systems away from your current world
1) A system that recieves a profitable trade from a world will not have a profitable trade returning to that world
## Fast Travel
Naeva features an extensive array of fast travel options based around an altered backstory.
1) The overgates are like hypergate highways, they were never meant to shut off and originally all hypergates routed to their gate hubs. In the northern and southernmost reaches of the galaxy you can still find functioning examples of the system, and the Polaris have a pristine system.
1) After an attack by the Vell-os, destabilized overgates were created. They can still send you in the target direction, but they've lost syncronicity with their partner. You'll be sent to a random uninhabited system instead of a gate hub.
1) Sigma Shipyards has salvaged the surviving hypergates and daisy chained them to each other, mostly bypassing the gate hubs. You can use their system for a fee.
1) Wormholes yet remain as a natural option, their destination ever unpredictable.
## Galactic Calamity
1) Earth floundered after a great wave of colony ships were launched into deep space. This was the Second Dark Age. The colony ships founded many worlds that are collectively referred to as the Frontier. When the remnants of humanity on Earth were sheparded by the Vell-os, they founded a superior civilization that leapfrogged the Frontier and generally left them isolated and ignored. Earth itself was eventually forgotten.
1) The deactivation of the Hypergate system was now caused by artificially induced supernovas at the gate hub systems, which puts the nova in Nova. This caused the Third Dark Age.
