  <description>A rounded engine has a balanced acceleration and cruising speed. The softer acceleration curve permits the storage of a small number of additional cargo pods and missiles, ensuring that this engine performs both in combat and logistical purposes.

This is the massive version, which is built around a ship whose size is staggering and purpose unfathomable.</description>
