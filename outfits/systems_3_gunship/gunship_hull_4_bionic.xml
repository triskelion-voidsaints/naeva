  <description>Like a standard hull, bionic hulls are perfectly balanced between shield capacity and armour strength. Their competitive edge comes with regards to regeneration, which is 30% greater in total than their competitors and is also perfectly balanced between shield recharge and hull repair.

This is the overtiny version, which fits the smallest of ships with a multi-person crew.</description>
