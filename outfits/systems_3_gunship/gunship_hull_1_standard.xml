  <description>Standard hulls are split between shield capacity and armour strength. In return for their lack of specialization, the total defensive capacity of this hull is 10% stronger compared to its competitors. They also feature a dedicated array of shield rechargers.

This is the overtiny version, which fits the smallest of ships with a multi-person crew.</description>
