  <description>A kangaroo engine is optimized to accelerate quickly at the cost of a low cruising speed. This jumpy profile is optimal for active combat engagements, but the lack of inhibitors prevents the incorporation of cargo preservation technologies.

This is the puny version, which only fits vehicles too small to be properly called a ship.</description>
