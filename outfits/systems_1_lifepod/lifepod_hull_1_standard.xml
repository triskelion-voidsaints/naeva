  <description>Standard hulls are split between shield capacity and armour strength. In return for their lack of specialization, the total defensive capacity of this hull is 10% stronger compared to its competitors. They also feature a dedicated array of shield rechargers.

This is the puny version, which only fits vehicles too small to be properly called a ship.</description>
