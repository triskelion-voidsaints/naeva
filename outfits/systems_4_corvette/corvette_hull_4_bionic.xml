  <description>Like a standard hull, bionic hulls are perfectly balanced between shield capacity and armour strength. Their competitive edge comes with regards to regeneration, which is 30% greater in total than their competitors and is also perfectly balanced between shield recharge and hull repair.

This is the small version, which fits the first class of ships considered to be a proper, independent starship.</description>
