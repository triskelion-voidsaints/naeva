  <description>Shielded hulls rely on a dedicated array of shield capacitors to provide best in class shield capacity, backed up by a dedicated array of shield rechargers. While the shipâ€™s structure is still sturdy, its hull does not mount armour and should not be relied upon to deflect fire.

This is the submedium version, which fits the smallest class of capital ships.</description>
