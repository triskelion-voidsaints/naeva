  <description>Shielded hulls rely on a dedicated array of shield capacitors to provide best in class shield capacity, backed up by a dedicated array of shield rechargers. While the shipâ€™s structure is still sturdy, its hull does not mount armour and should not be relied upon to deflect fire.

This is the large version, which is built on a ship that is a fleet unto itself.</description>
