  <description>A rounded engine has a balanced acceleration and cruising speed. The softer acceleration curve permits the storage of a small number of additional cargo pods and missiles, ensuring that this engine performs both in combat and logistical purposes.

This is the large version, which is built on a ship that is a fleet unto itself.</description>
