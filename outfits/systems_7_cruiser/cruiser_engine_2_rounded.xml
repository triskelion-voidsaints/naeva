  <description>A rounded engine has a balanced acceleration and cruising speed. The softer acceleration curve permits the storage of a small number of additional cargo pods and missiles, ensuring that this engine performs both in combat and logistical purposes.

This is the overmedium version, which is designed to accommodate a ship of the line.</description>
