  <description>A kangaroo engine is optimized to accelerate quickly at the cost of a low cruising speed. This jumpy profile is optimal for active combat engagements, but the lack of inhibitors prevents the incorporation of cargo preservation technologies.

This is the overmedium version, which is designed to accommodate a ship of the line.</description>
