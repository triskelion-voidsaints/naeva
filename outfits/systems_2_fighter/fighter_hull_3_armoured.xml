  <description>Armoured hulls feature thick hull plating that can stand up to an extensive beating before failing. They also have damage control and repair systems that can patch up the hull in a pinch, but not with any speed compared to a shield generator. An armoured hullâ€™s shield grid is second rate, but remains a factor.

This is the tiny version, which is designed for those ships commonly crewed by a single pilot.</description>
