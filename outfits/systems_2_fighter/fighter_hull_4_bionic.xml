  <description>Like a standard hull, bionic hulls are perfectly balanced between shield capacity and armour strength. Their competitive edge comes with regards to regeneration, which is 30% greater in total than their competitors and is also perfectly balanced between shield recharge and hull repair.

This is the tiny version, which is designed for those ships commonly crewed by a single pilot.</description>
