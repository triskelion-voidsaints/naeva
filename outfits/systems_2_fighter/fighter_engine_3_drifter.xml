  <description>A drifter engine accelerates slowly, but has a high cruising speed. This engine excels in a situation where your enemies can be planned and accounted for, so your guns cover your retreat. The gentle acceleration curve allows your ship to hold a good deal of cargo pods and missiles, slanting it towards a logistical role.

This is the tiny version, which is designed for those ships commonly crewed by a single pilot.</description>
