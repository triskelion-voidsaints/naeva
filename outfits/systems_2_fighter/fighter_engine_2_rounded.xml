  <description>A rounded engine has a balanced acceleration and cruising speed. The softer acceleration curve permits the storage of a small number of additional cargo pods and missiles, ensuring that this engine performs both in combat and logistical purposes.

This is the tiny version, which is designed for those ships commonly crewed by a single pilot.</description>
