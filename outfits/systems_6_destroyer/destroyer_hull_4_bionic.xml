  <description>Like a standard hull, bionic hulls are perfectly balanced between shield capacity and armour strength. Their competitive edge comes with regards to regeneration, which is 30% greater in total than their competitors and is also perfectly balanced between shield recharge and hull repair.

This is the medium version, which is designed to fit the standard size of capital ship.</description>
