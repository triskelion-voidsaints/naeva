 <description>The Federation is the latest in a string of successor governments to the Manifest, the greatest human civilization. They are a democratic successor to the Overwatch, which sought to protect the systems surrounding Forge from expansionist Auroran warlords and the revengeful Polaris. The Federation inherits that mandate, but allows greater self-governance for member worlds and appointment of global representatives to the Federation Council.</description>
